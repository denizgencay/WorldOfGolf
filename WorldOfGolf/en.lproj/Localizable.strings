"main_screen_text" = "The exact date of golf's origin is not known, but it is believed to have been invented by Scottish shepherds who tried to roll stones into rabbit holes with their staffs. Although many historians do not agree, it is believed that golf was born in the Roman Empire and the game was played with bent sticks and a ball stuffed with feathers. According to other theories, golf appeared in China, during the Ming Dynasty, this is evidenced by a scroll depicting the emperor, who tries something similar to a club to drive a ball into a hole. Nevertheless, modern golf comes from Scotland. The first mention of the game is considered to be an edict in 1457 by King James II of Scotland to ban golf, because it distracted archers from learning. It was there that the rules were invented and the system with 18 holes per course.
In 1900, golf was included for the first time in the Olympic Games in Paris, France.";

"rules_text" = "Since golf is essentially a self-regulating game, all golfers should have a good understanding of the basic rules contained in this manual. However, this guide is not a substitute for the rules of golf, which should be referred to whenever there is any doubt.
Before you start your round:
- Read the local rules on the scorecard or on the information board
- Put an identification mark on the ball. Many golfers play the same brand of balls, and if you cannot identify your ball, it will be considered lost.
- Count your clubs; you are allowed a maximum of 14 clubs.
During the round:
- Do not ask for advice from anyone other than your partner (your team player) or your caddies. Do not give advice to anyone other than your partner. But you may ask questions about rules, distances and positions of obstacles, flags, etc.
- No practice strokes of any kind are allowed on the hole during play.
At the end of the round:
- In match play, make sure the result of the match is recorded
- In scoring play, make sure the score card is fully drawn and return it as soon as possible.";

"inventory_text" = "A player can take no more than 14 clubs to a game, each club is designed to perform a particular stroke. Golf clubs are divided into two types:

'Wood' (Woods) - clubs designed to perform strokes at maximum distances, usually these are the first strokes. They are called 'wood' because of the wooden head, although modern woods are made of titanium-based metal alloys.
 
'Iron' (irons) are clubs designed to hit at different distances, depending on the position of the ball. Sticks are so named because their head is made of metal. In addition to the material, hockey sticks differ in the shape of their heads.  So, for strikes at short distances and with a high trajectory used clubs 'pitching wedge' (angle of inclination of such clubs is 50-60 degrees. If you need to hit from a sandbox, you can use a sand wedge, it has a heavier sole and a special shape. For finishing kicks, players use a stick called 'putter', it is designed specifically for hitting on a flat surface with great accuracy.
 In the 'wood' and 'iron' groups, clubs are numbered according to the angle between the club and the front hitting surface of the head. The smaller the number, the longer the potential stroke path. The difference in the length of strokes by clubs of neighboring numbers is about 10 meters.

Another important part of golf equipment are balls. They should have the following characteristics: a diameter of not less than 4.27 cm, the weight in the range 41-46 grams, the surface of the ball should have 300-500 hollows (the more hollows, the higher the ball flies),
 
When considering golf balls, the 'compression' factor should be mentioned. In simple words, compression is the level of deformation of the ball at impact. Its conventional value ranges from 0 (the ball is severely deformed at impact) to 200 (the ball does not deform at impact). Most balls have a compression of 80-100 (compresses for 2-3 mm at impact). According to the inner structure balls may consist of one, two, three or more layers-components. Balls with one layer are ideal for beginners because of its low cost.  Double-layered balls consist of a hard core and a thin, rigid shell. They combine low cost, durability and range, so they are suitable for most golfers. Three-layer balls have an elastic yarn winding over an elastic or gel core. These balls can be very heavily spun, sometimes to the athletes' advantage. In four-layer balls, there is an extra layer between the braid and the sheath. The potential of such balls can be revealed only by professionals.";

"detail_text" = "A golf course must meet a number of requirements, namely it must consist of a series of holes, each hole must have its own starting area. There are two marks on the starting tee which show the allowable boundaries of the tee area. In addition to the starting area, the course includes a smooth course, an uneven course and other obstacles. The final part of the site is a hole, which is marked with a flag for ease of orientation. The hole is placed in the area with a minimum height of grass, which is called 'green'. In the other areas of grass height varies, this is done to make it difficult for the players to pass the site. As a rule, the holes are located in the line of sight from the starting area to the green. But this is not always the case, if the holes deviate to the left or right, such holes are called 'left dogleg' and 'right 'dogleg' respectively. If the direction bends twice, the hole is commonly referred to as a 'double dogleg.' Pads consist of 18 holes, but there are pads with 9 holes, in this situation they are passed twice, which in total is the same 18 holes.";

As an amateur, Jones often defeated the best professional golfers of the Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen era. In 1930, Jones won all four majors, effectively creating what he called a 'grand slam.'

But after an 11-year championship drought, Tiger Woods scored one of the greatest victories in all of sports and won the 2019 Masters to continue to make his name in history. Woods changed the game, brought it to the masses and is undoubtedly a major reason why golfers today look more like 'athletes' than ever before.

Along with his record 18 major victories, Nicklas finished second in the majors 19 times and was third nine times. He finished his career ranked in the top 10 in 73 of the 164 majors in which he participated. Nicklas is also a 73-time PGA Tour winner (third all-time).
